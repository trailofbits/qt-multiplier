# Multiplier GUI

**A graphical user interface for exploring and analyzing code using the Multiplier framework.**

Multiplier GUI provides developers with an intuitive, visual way to navigate complex codebases, understand code relationships, and perform in-depth code analysis. Built with Qt 6, it offers a modern, responsive interface for working with Multiplier-indexed code databases.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start with Pre-built Binaries

#### Latest CI Builds
Get the most recent build artifacts automatically generated by our CI pipeline:

1. Visit the [repository homepage](https://github.com/trailofbits/qt-multiplier)
2. Click the green checkmark next to the latest commit
3. Select the **Details** link for your platform's build
4. Navigate to **Summary** in the top-left corner
5. Download the appropriate package for your system

#### CI Releases
Stable, tagged releases are available at: [qt-multiplier releases](https://github.com/trailofbits/qt-multiplier/releases)

#### Installing on Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
# Install the package
sudo dpkg -i package-name.deb

# Install any missing dependencies
sudo apt install -f
```

### Running the Application

**💡 Pro Tip: A sample database (created from the uBPF library) is available in our build artifacts for immediate testing.**

1. **Generate a database** using `mx-index` from the [multiplier repository](https://github.com/trailofbits/multiplier):
   ```bash
   mx-index --target compile_commands.json --db database.mx
   ```

2. **Launch the application**:
   - **macOS**: Open `Multiplier.app`
   - **Linux**: Run the installed executable
   - **Windows**: Launch the executable from the installation directory

3. **Load your database**: Select your generated `database.mx` file
